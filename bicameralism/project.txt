Frequent elections are unquestionably the only policy by which this dependence and sympathy can be effectually secured.” Popular elections to the House were an essential part of the checks on governmental power: “A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government…”  Madison explained that using state constitutional guidelines for identifying electors was “the best that lay within their [the States] option.” The states would not accept, and the Convention delegates could have settled upon, a “uniform rule” for electors from every state. At the same time, since the qualifications of electors are “fixed by the State constitutions, it is not alterable by the state governments, and it cannot be feared that the people of the states will alter this part of their constitutions in such a manner as to abridge the rights secured to them by the federal Constitution.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Slide6973","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The \"People's\" House of Representatives in Constitutional Context","thumbnail":"dr/Slide6973_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14404","S4_button_previous","si20469","si20483","S4_button_next","si20499","si20513","Text_Caption_117","Text_Caption_118","Text_Caption_119"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide6973"}}},{"id":"si14513","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14515","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_39","title":"Bicameralism ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_126","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"The “People’s” House of Representatives in Constitutional Context ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_122","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_122","title":"“…open to merit of every description…” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_123","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_123","title":"Both the age limit and number of years as a citizen were proposed at the Convention by George Mason of Virginia and settled upon after a modest debate.

The question of apportioning seats in the House, including numerous amendments regarding the total number of House members and the number of each state, was debated for weeks. The debate focused on whether wealth as well as population should be considered in allocating the number of representatives to the House and whether slaves should be counted as persons. On July 13, the delegates voted to remove “wealth” as a consideration for apportioning House seats. Ultimately, the size of the House was increased from 56 in the original motion to 65, one for every 30,000 inhabitants and passed with the allocation of seats for the first Congress in Article I, Section 2 on August 6. The delegates also settled on ten years as the length of time for reapportionment.

In the Apportionment Act of 1842, Congress increased membership in the House of Representatives to 223 and required states to create only single-member districts, although population sizes varied substantially across districts. The three-fifths provision was modified after the Civil War by the 14th Amendment (Section 2) in 1868, which requires that “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to the respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.” Using the standard that no district would be greater than 30,000, Congress used various methods every ten years for resolving unequal ratios of seats per state. In 1872, Congress required states to create districts with equal numbers of people “as nearly as practical.” After the 1910 Census, the size of the House had grown to 435 under the Apportionment Act of 1911. After failing to reapportion seats after the 1920 Census, Congress passed the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 that capped the number of House seats at 435.

During ratification, Madison stated in Federalist No. 62 that “a government ought to be founded on the principles of a mixture of proportional and equal representation,” and the composition of the Senate was a result of compromise not of theory. He did concede, though, that the equal vote of the states would be “an instrument for preserving that residuary sovereignty” of the states. The selection of senators by state legislatures also had the prospect of improving representation and strengthening federalism. Giving state legislatures a role in the process had a “double advantage of favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the State governments such an agency in the formation of the federal government as must secure the authority of the former.”  In Centinel No. 1 the Antifederalists took a very different view of both the “equal vote” of two senators per state and the election by state legislatures. Rather, they argued, the Senate “is constituted on unequal principles. The smallest state in the union has equal weight with the great states of Virginia, Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania…” As for the six-year term and appointment by the state legislatures: “The term and mode of its appointment, will lead to permanency…” Thus, the Senate would be “devoid of all responsibility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that so far from being a regular balanced government, it would be in practice a permanent ARISTOCRACY.” Madison, as we shall see on the next slide, saw things very differently.

The effort to amend the Constitution so that senators would be directly elected by the people began with a resolution introduced in the House by New York Congressman Henry Randolph Storrs on February 14, 1826. From that point, 187 similar resolutions were introduced until the 17th Amendment was ratified in 1913. Over time, the House passed six resolutions on different occasions before the Senate finally approved. The movement picked up steam in the 52nd Congress, when the Democrats took majority control in the House after the 1890 elections, and ultimately culminated in ratification of the 17th Amendment 23 years later.

In light of this political pressure, on May 12, 1912, the Senate adopted the 17th Amendment by a vote of 64-24 with 3 abstentions; the House followed suit, voting 238-39, with 110 abstentions. It took less than eleven months for states to ratify the amendment, when Connecticut became the 36thh state to vote in favor.  Rossum finds that during the many debates over direct election, only a handful of senators raised concerns about how it would impact federalism. One Senator, Franklin Bartlett (D-NY) stated in a House debate during the 53rd Congress: “the Framers of the Constitution, if they were present in this House today, would inevitably regard this resolution as a most direct blow at the doctrine of States’ rights and at the integrity of the State sovereignties; for if you once deprive a state as a collective organism of all share in the General Government, you annihilate its federative importance.” Senator George F. Hoar (R-MA) agreed: “Here, in the State legislature, is to be found the great security against the encroachment upon the rights of the States.”   (Click to expand the campaign poster.)

Seniority, reciprocity, legislative work, specialization, and courtesy informed the behavior of most senators. By the 1980s, those norms began to erode as a combination of rising partisanship and individual entrepreneurship conspired to make the Senate a more polarized and individualistic body. At least in terms of partisanship, and responsiveness to partisanship, the Senate today seems more like the House. However, differences in organization and rules between the two chambers make the House a different type of lawmaking body than the Senate. The House runs on the principle and practice of majority rule, whereas the Senate emphasizes individual and minority rights. A good deal of the differences relate to the sizes of the two chambers, an artifact and outgrowth of the Constitution.

A party unity score for an individual member is the percentage of times the member votes with the majority of their party on party unity votes. A member with a 95% party unity score is deemed highly partisan because they vote with the party on nearly every vote that divides the two parties, whereas one with a 55% score is not very partisan because they only vote with the party just over half the time. The average party unit score for all Democrats and all Republicans in a given year serves as a measure of overall partisanship for each party.

Thus, a larger portion of senators than representatives are likely to face a challenger, either from within their own party or by a candidate from the other party, and a larger portion of Senate incumbents are defeated for re-election. In elections from 1990 to 2012, an average of 93% of House members compared with 88% of senators were re-elected from among those running for office. A larger percentage of senators than House members face competitive elections.

Senate incumbents spend more money on re-election than the House incumbents, even when controlling for the length of terms. In 2012, the average cost of winning a House seat was $1,596,953 whereas the average senate seat cost $10,351,556, largely as a result of the need for senators to run statewide across multiple different media markets.

The Speaker uses the Rules Committee to control the agenda, which is geared toward advancing the majority party’s issues and maximizing its chances of keeping the majority. Indeed, of the 13 members of the Rules Committee, 9 are from the majority party, and 4 are from the minority party, a ratio that undermines the minority party’s ability to influence the rules of debate in the House. The Rules Committee often restricts floor amendments that might either divide the majority party internally or, if offered by the minority party, force the majority to vote on politically sensitive issues. Regardless of which party controls the majority in the House, the percentage of restrictive rules on bills going to the floor (including closed rules and structured rules that allow specified amendments) has become routine. While the Democrats had the majority in the 110th  Congress (2007-2008), 86% of all rules were restrictive; and while the Republicans were in the majority in the 113th Congress (2013-14), 91% of all rules were restrictive. The House Rules Committee has become an instrument of the majority party, and it can choose whether or not to allow the minority to offer amendments. Members of the majority differ on some issues that come to the House floor, but the majority party almost never votes to defeat a resolution from the Rules Committee. Rules create order, and the majority decides the rules in the House.

Political Scientist Eric Shickler summarizes the current state of bicameralism:   Today’s House has returned to a level of party strength not seen in nearly a century, while the Senate remains highly individualistic, notwithstanding its high level of partisan acrimony. Although developments in the two chambers have typically moved in tandem, the general pattern is for formal party leaders to enjoy greater prerogatives in the House, while the smaller Senate has featured greater individual prerogatives, looser rules, and weaker party leaders.  In order for lawmaking to work, both chambers need to agree to the same legislative language and earn the president’s signature. The ability of one chamber to check the priorities of the other, a fundamental principle of the framers’ goal of protecting liberty, remains a key feature of the Congress.
