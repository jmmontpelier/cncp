Those included a mixture of direct participation of citizens in an assembly and a representative council chosen by lot. Participation, representation, and decision making ideally conformed to the concept of classical republicanism—citizens and their representatives should be educated, virtuous, and engaged in public affairs. Republican government could work in a small community of homogeneous people who could deliberate over the common good. The virtues of the classical republican citizens and representatives were espoused by Aristotle (384-322 BC) in his book Politics. Ancient Rome provided another example of a republic, and the concept of classical republicanism was further developed by Cicero (106-43 BC), a statesman and a scholar at the end of the Roman Republic.  The framers also knew the British Parliament as a representative body. The British Parliament evolved from assemblies of nobles who advised the monarch about important matters. By the 13th century, and particularly after Magna Carta in 1215—the monarchs ceded significant authority, particularly over matters of taxation, to the nobles, clergy, landed gentry, and local officials who served as a check on the powers of the kings and queens. Parliament gradually gained independent power, and by the 17th century had dramatically curtailed the power of the monarchs to influence law making. That is the Parliament that was familiar to the framers of the American Constitution.

Athens, Sparta, Crete, Carthage, and early Rome had representative assemblies of different classes of people and councils of elders. Madison explains the necessary function of a senate and the distinction between ancient republics and the American Congress in Federalist No. 63. “Long lived” republics, such as Sparta, Rome, and Carthage had senates. The British Parliament, with its House of Commons and House of Lords, constituted another example of bicameralism. And, most of the state governments at the time of the Founding had bicameral legislatures.  Madison argued that bicameralism played a critical role in tempering the potential for abusive legislative power. History provided “very instructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend stability and liberty.” Thus, a “well-constructed Senate” can serve as a check in popular or “free” governments “in particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterward be the most ready to lament and condemn.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_973","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_973","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88473","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88487","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1416","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1416","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1417","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1417","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide81503","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Bicameralism","thumbnail":"dr/Slide81503_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si81537","si81539","Image_1284","Text_Caption_1408","Button_973","si88473","si88487","Image_1416","Image_1417"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide81503"}}},{"id":"si81707","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1285","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1285","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_419","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_419","title":"Early Development of the Legislative Branch and the Problem of Representation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_267","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_267","title":"Separation of Powers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1415","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1415","title":"Several ancient constitutions in Greece and the Roman Republic had a separation of powers. Eighteenth-century French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu traces the doctrine of separation of powers to Aristotle. In Politics, Aristotle established the principle that all governments should have three functions: “the deliberative, the magisterial, and the judicative” which coincide, respectively, with the legislative (law-making), executive (law-enforcing), and judicial (law-interpreting) functions of government. Yet Aristotle did not advocate the separation of those powers. Montesquieu elaborated on this framework in the Spirit of the Laws by explaining the practical purpose of separation the powers of government.  Madison similarly emphasized the necessity of separation of powers in Federalist No. 47.

Classical political philosophers, for example, believed in mixing republican or democratic forms of government with other regime types. In Book III of Politics, Aristotle defines six types of regiments according to the number of rulers and whether they are good or bad (see image, right). Aristotle, and later Cicero, believed the most attainable and stable constitutions had a mixture of forms. Although the Federalists thought a purely democratic regime placed too much confidence in the people, they did not support mixing republican government (in which rulers were elected by the people) with a monarchical or aristocratic form of government.  Moreover, echoing the natural rights philosophy of English political philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), most Federalists thought that the purpose of government was not merely to foster civic virtue or advance the common good, but to protect personal liberties, including property. Those objectives are introduced in the Declaration of Independence, which defined the principles or goals of the American regime: ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1286","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1286","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1288","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1288","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_977","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_977","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88563","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88577","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_978","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_978","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88593","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si88607","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide81754","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"American Forms of Representation, Bicameralism, and Separation of Powers","thumbnail":"dr/Slide81754_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si81788","si81790","Text_Caption_1418","Image_1286","Image_1288","Button_977","si88563","si88577","Button_978","si88593","si88607"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide81754"}}},{"id":"si81899","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1403","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1403","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_421","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_421","title":"Early Development of the Legislative Branch and the Problem of Representation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_269","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_269","title":"American Forms of Representation, Bicameralism, and Separation of Powers ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1419","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1419","title":"Prior to the Revolution ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1420","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1420","title":"The political concepts we have explored thus far played out in interesting and specific ways as the American nation took shape under the new Constitution.

Madison defined it as “a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of community.” Factions flourished naturally in free societies, and in small republics factions could easily coalesce and form an “interested and overbearing majority” that could regularly dominate public affairs and, in so doing, violate the liberties of the minority.  Contrary to Montesquieu’s “prevailing Theory,” Madison believed that small republics create greater “inconveniences” than larger ones. The smaller the state, the more likely a permanent majority faction is to form against the interests of the minority. Madison’s answer to the problem was a large or “extended” republic. The notion that a large republic could successfully and sustainably protect individual liberty and advance the public good was a novel concept that emerged from the American Founding period.

Among the most egregious acts were: ignoring colonial laws, dissolving legislative assemblies, imposing taxes without consent, and abolishing laws and charters. Thus, the Declaration proclaimed: “A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.” A representative government without a king would be the inevitable consequence of victory of Greater Britain.  Not long after defeating the British, problems of governance were evident in the states and with the Articles of Confederation. Joseph Bessette cites several examples of powerful state legislatures that “too often passed foolish and short-sighted measures,” or “encroached on the constitutional spheres of the executive and judicial branches.” Pennsylvania, which had a unicameral legislature, was “one of the worst offenders.” The legislature “arrogated executive authority by appointing various state and local officials, pardoning criminals, and drawing money from the treasury; and it assumed judicial power by deciding specific legal disputes and even dissolving marriages.” Pennsylvania’s assembly repealed the charters of the College of Pennsylvania and the Bank of North America, “an institution vital to a stable currency and commerce.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_989","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_989","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89265","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89279","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_990","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_990","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89295","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89309","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1422","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1422","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1423","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1423","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1532","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1532","title":"Independence Hall, PA. © Ken Lund.

Rhode Island’s state representatives served six-month terms, short enough for public opinion to have decisive and dramatic effects on public policy. In 1786, one month after the Assembly refused, by a vote of 43-18, to issue paper money, the state held an election and the result was a “wholesale turnover in state government and a complete ascendancy of the proponents of paper money in both the legislative and executive branches.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1437","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1437","title":"Bessette describes the consequences:   Within a few weeks the legislature issued paper money with a nominal value of 100,000 pounds. Property owners were able to borrow the paper for up to half the values of their land, with payments on the principle to begin in seven years. The paper was made full legal tender in all commercial transactions and in payment for all debts past, present, or future. Realizing that the creditors who had previously loaned out gold or silver would freely accept the new paper in repayment, the legislature stipulated that anyone could discharge a debt by depositing an appropriate amount of paper money at a court.  The money depreciated to one-fourth its face value within four months. When the banks and merchants refused to accept the depreciating paper, the legislature made it a criminal offense. The economy crumbled as merchants closed their shops, farmers from neighboring states would not accept cash, and creditors hid from debtors trying to pay off their debts. After the Rhode Island Superior Court voided several legislative acts, all but one of the judges lost reelection. Ultimately, by 1789, the laws were repealed.

At the national level, the Congress under the Articles lacked the capacity to pass legislation binding all thirteen colonies/states. At the state level, certain legislatures were too democratic or too independent; in such cases representative bodies were “too strong.” Ultimately, the solution would be to design a national representative body that was powerful enough to address problems, but not too responsive to public opinion or too powerful to act tyrannically.  Under the Articles, the Congress could only request money from the states; it had no power to tax or to regulate commerce, and it was unable to exercise authority over individuals. Each state had one vote and it took nine votes from the thirteen states to enact a law and unanimous consent to amend the Articles. Moreover, the delegates to the Congress were beholden to state legislatures, who could recall delegates if necessary. In addition, there was no chief executive and no national court.

The inability to act in concert was especially problematic in commercial affairs. The states lacked uniformity of laws concerning naturalization, copyrights, seminaries, grants of incorporation, and public utilities. The government’s inability to sanction or coerce compliance left the Confederation as “nothing more than a treat of amity commerce and of alliance, between so many independent and Sovereign States.” It was unrealistic to gain unanimous consent and even more so to expect voluntary compliance with each other, making any acts of Congress mere recommendations to the state legislatures. Finally, since in some states the Articles were ratified by the state legislature instead of the people, the states were a “league of sovereign powers.” If one state violated an obligation under the Articles of Confederation, none of the other states would be bound by it.

The representatives have three possible motivations: (1) ambition, (2) personal interest, and (3) the public good. “Unhappily,” said Madison, “the first two are proved by experiences to be the most prevalent.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_999","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_999","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89865","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89879","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1000","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1000","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89895","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si89909","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide82829","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Commerce, its Restrictions, and the Multiplicity and Mutability of State Laws","thumbnail":"dr/Slide82829_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si82863","Text_Caption_1446","Text_Caption_1447","Text_Caption_1448","Button_999","si89865","si89879","Button_1000","si89895","si89909"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide82829"}}},{"id":"si82950","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si82952","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_432","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_432","title":"Early Development of the Legislative Branch and the Problem of Representation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_280","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_280","title":"Vices of the Political System ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1449","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1449","title":"The People ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1450","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1450","title":"Madison noted that people may be “a still more fatal if not more frequent cause” of injustice.

Madison contended that majority faction could not be prevented by general concerns for the common good, by respect for character of others, or even by religion. Representative government had to be redesigned in order to protect individual liberty.  In a later appeal to his countrymen to support ratification for the Constitution, Madison described the urgency of the moment (click on quote, left).

On May 29, 1787, Edmund Randolph presented the Virginia Plan, authored by Madison, which sought to replace the Articles of Confederation with a unitary form of government. The Plan proposed a bicameral legislature, in which the lower house was elected by the people and the upper house was elected by the lower house. The number of representatives to each house would be in proportion to the population of the states. Both houses would elect the president and appoint judges, and the legislature would have the power to veto acts of the state legislatures. The Virginia Plan created a very powerful Congress, too powerful according to delegates from several smaller states.  Resolving questions about the shape of the new Constitution and government required a series of compromises too numerous to cover in this module. Here the focus will be on the two most important compromises at the Convention related to the problem of representation. Subsequent modules will describe how the delegates to the Convention dealt with legislative powers, qualifications for office, elections, bicameral differences, and relationship with the executive and judicial branches.

The next day, June 8, the Virginia Plan suffered another blow.

On July 16, the Convention took up a proposal that came to be known as the Great Compromise, or Connecticut Compromise, named for Connecticut delegates Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. They proposed a bicameral legislature with different forms of representation. The number of representatives from each state to one of the chambers, the House, would be apportioned by the size of a state’s population, whereas the number for the other chamber, the Senate, would be equal for each state. The Convention delegates, with one vote per state, voted 5-4 in favor of the plan.  On September 17, 1787, 39 of 42 remaining delegates to the Convention signed the Constitution.

One month later, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify. Except for a close vote in Massachusetts (187-168), the state conventions had little trouble reaching consensus. But, without the support of two of the largest states, Virginia and New York, the Constitution would have little practical feasibility.  The Virginia Convention met in June and featured spirited debates between Antifederalist Patrick Henry and Federalist Henry Lee. Madison also engaged Patrick Henry, though with more repose. The debate lasted over three weeks. History deemed the Federalists, particularly Madison, victorious over the formidable Henry. In his analysis of the debate, political scientist John Roche observes: “Henry would give a four- or five-hour speech denouncing some sections of the Constitution on every conceivable ground…” Then, “Mr. Lee of Westermoreland would rise and literally poleaxe him with sardonic invective.” Thereafter, “the gentlemanly Constitutionalists [Madison, Pendleton, and Marshall] would pick up matters at issue and examine them in the light of reason.” Writing in 1960, Roche concluded, “modern Americans who tend to think of James Madison as a rather desiccated character should spend some time with his transcript.” He praises Madison’s “spectacular demonstration of nimble rhetoric” in challenging Henry and concludes, in reference to Madison’s argument, “To devise an assault route into his rhetorical fortress was literally impossible.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1493","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1493","title":"Antifederalist  Patrick Henry ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1339","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1339","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1494","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1494","title":"Federalist Henry Lee ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_1340","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1340","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_1015","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1015","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90645","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90659","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1016","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1016","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90675","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90689","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_1432","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1432","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1433","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1433","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_950","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_950","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90555","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90569","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_951","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_951","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90585","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90599","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide83724","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Virginia Debates the Constitution","thumbnail":"dr/Slide83724_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si83758","si83760","Text_Caption_1469","Text_Caption_1470","Text_Caption_1493","Image_1339","Text_Caption_1494","Image_1340","Button_1015","si90645","si90659","Button_1016","si90675","si90689","Image_1432","Image_1433","Button_950","si90555","si90569","Button_951","si90585","si90599"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide83724"}}},{"id":"si91043","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si91045","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_1301","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_1301","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_440","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_440","title":"Early Development of the Legislative Branch and the Problem of Representation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_288","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_288","title":"Ratification of the Constitution ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_1017","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1017","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90765","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90779","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_1018","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_1018","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90795","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si90809","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_1518","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_1518","title":"On June 25, 1788, Virginia narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 89-79, and, one month later, New York followed suit by an even tighter margin (30-27).
