However, some of the discussions in the ratification conventions, particularly of Clause 4, indicate that the measurement was indeed thought out. Thomas Davies at the Massachusetts convention and Richard Spaight at the North Carolina convention both suggest and later dismiss the idea of basing direct taxation on the basis of land area rather than population. Davies concludes his speech simply, \"the rule laid down in the paragraph is the best that can be obtained for the apportionment of the little direct taxes which Congress will want.\"</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s14="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Click to Explore</p>",s22="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Clause 3</p>",s21="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Clause 2</p>",s35="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article I, Section 10, Clause 2 prohibits states from laying a duty on any imports and exports, except those \"absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection laws,\" without consent of the Congress. Joseph Story in Commentaries on the Constitution 2 observes that, with this clause, \"a petty warfare of regulation is thus prevented, which would rouse resentments, and create dissensions, to the ruin of the harmony and amity of the states.\" The original draft discussed at the Convention did not include export duties, but this piece was later added at the suggestion of Rufus King (August 28). The clause did not pass until the provision was added that the United States treasury and Congress could alter these limitations.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s29="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 prohibits the passage of bills of attainder or ex post facto laws. Bills of attainder are pieces of legislation that can declare individuals guilty of a crime without a fair trial and ex post facto laws punish a crime after it was committed. There was relative unanimity at the Convention on the inclusion of the provision against bills of attainder. The ex post facto provision raised greater debate because some delegates such as Morris, Ellsworth, and Wilson felt that \"ex post facto laws were void of themselves\" (August 29). After Dickinson of Delaware presented the legal defition of ex post facto as applying only to criminal cases, they agreed to include this provision. At the state ratification conventions, there was no relevant discussion of this clause.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s31="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article 1, Section 9, Clause 6 states that \"No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another; nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear or pay Duties in another.\" This provision sought to ensure that federal regulations did not preference one state's ports over those of other states. In addition, this provision sought to remedy the historic problem of interstate good exchange during the period of the Articles of Confederation, when duties between states were so high that oftentimes merchants were encouraged to look to international trade partners by prohibiting states from taxing goods that originated in another state.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s26="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Clause 8</p>",s16="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">Article 1, Section 9</p>",s28="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 forbids suspension of habeas corpus, or unlawful apprehension and imprisonment. After Pinckney and John Routledge of South Carolina bickered over whether or not habeas corpus could ever justly be suspended, Pennsylvania delegate Gouverneur Morris proposed, and the Convention adopted, the addition of the phrase \"unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\" (August 28). Morris' amendment later became President Lincoln's saving grace during the Civil War when he restricted this right. The Massachusetts and New Hampshire ratifying conventions both discussing putting a time limit on suspension of habeas corpus even under extreme conditions. Otherwise, this clause was generally accepted.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s9="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article 1, Sections 9 &amp; 10</p>",s36="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 prevents states from keeping troops or ships of war in times of peace, entering into a compact or agreement with another state, or engaging in war without the consent of Congress, unless in the face of imminent danger. This provision again reflects fears reminiscent of the disjointed Articles government. The provision that a state not \"engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay,\" is a somehat disjointed from the prohibition of keeping troops or ships of war in times of peace. However, in Commentaries on the United States Constitution 2, Story carefully explains that \"The danger may be too imminent for delay; and under such circumstances, a state will have a right to raise troops for its own safety, even without the consent of congress.\"</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s32="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 states that: \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\" Joseph Story in Commentaries on the United States Constitution 3 also cites that importance of congressional control of appropriations to protect funds from exclusively executive power.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s33="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Article 1, Section 9, Clause 8 states that, \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office or Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince or foreign State.\" Delegate Pinckney proposed the eighth clause at the Convention, which prohibits the United State from granting titles of nobility and any office-holder in the United States from accepting a title of nobility from a foreign entity (August 23). The clause clearly reflects hostility toward the recently-cut ties with the British monarchy.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\"></p>",s34="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​After limiting the powers of the Federal government in Article 1, Section 9, the Constitution limits the power of the state governments in Article I, Section 10. Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 reflects the problems under the Articles of Confederation. First and foremost, that clause restricts states from forming any alliances with foreign nations, leaving this power expressly to the executive branch. Under the confederation government, many states, especially in the South, had developed trade alliances with European nations such as England, France, and Spain. Under the new Constitution, however, those alliances were viewed as detrimental to national unity. Clause 1 also limits granting \"letters of marque or reprisal,\" which would endorse acts of piracy against private seafaring vessels. The clause also prevents states from coining money, another source of detriment to the nascent American economy in the aftermath of the revolution. And, the clause repeats some of the national government limitations in Article I, Section 9, including \"Bills of Attainder, ex post facto laws, and Titles of Nobility.\"</p><p style=\"margin:0px\">​</p>",s27="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​The first and arguably most controversial clause in Article 1, Section 9 sets forth that Congress cannot end the importation of \"such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit\" (slaves) until 1808, but does have the right to place a duty of up to $10 on any new migrants. This provision represents a compromise between the delegates—mostly southerners—who sought to protect slavery and delegates who sought to eliminate it. At the Federal Convention, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina claimed that his state could \"never receive the plan if it prohibits the slave trade\" (August 21). Staunch abolitionists, like Rufus King of Massachusetts, favored immediate prohibition of importation. He felt \"the admission of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his mind, &amp; he believed would be so to a great part of the people of America.\" Delegates from states like Maryland and Delaware were more accepting of the clause, whereas others, like Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman of Connecticut, who opposed slavery in principle, were willing to compromise with Southern states in order to create the Constitution.</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​</p><p style=\"margin: 0px;\">Madison expressed support for the future limit on the importation of slaves, which he later summarized in Federalist No. 42: \"It ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of twenty years may terminate for ever within thee States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraded the barbarism of modern policy.\" One Antifederalist was more realistic: \"to prohibit the importation of slaves is not to abolish slavery…this country may remain degraded by this impious custom till the end of time.\" Indeed, twenty years later, the institution of slavery was still very much alive and growing.</p>",s18="<p style=\"margin: 0px;\">​Clause 1</p>",s19="<p

This provision represents a compromise between the delegates&mdash;mostly southerners&mdash;who sought to protect slavery and delegates who sought to eliminate it. At the Federal Convention, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina claimed that his state could &quot;never receive the plan if it prohibits the slave trade&quot; (August 21). Staunch abolitionists, like Rufus King of Massachusetts, favored immediate prohibition of importation. He felt &quot;the admission of slaves was a most grating circumstance to his mind, &amp; he believed would be so to a great part of the people of America.&quot; Delegates from states like Maryland and Delaware were more accepting of the clause, whereas others, like Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman of Connecticut, who opposed slavery in principle, were willing to compromise with Southern states in order to create the Constitution.<br /><br />​Madison expressed support for the future limit on the importation of slaves, which he later summarized in <em>Federalist</em> No. 42: &quot;It ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period fo twenty years may terminate for ever within thee States, a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraded the barbarism of modern policy.&quot; One Antifederalist was more realistic: &quot;to prohibit the importation of slaves is not to abolish slavery&#8230;this country may remain degraded by this impious custom till the end of time.&quot; Indeed, twenty years later, the institution of slavery was still very much alive and growing.");sym.$("txt_a1s9c2").html("Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 forbids suspension of <em>habeas corpus</em>, or unlawful apprehension and imprisonment. After Pinckney and John Routledge of South Carolina bickered over whether or not <em>habeas corpus</em> could ever justly be suspended, Pennsylvania delegate Gouverneur Morris proposed, and the Convention adopted, the addition of the phrase &quot;unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it&quot; (August 28). Morris' amendment later became President Lincoln's saving grace during the Civil War when he restricted this right. The Massachusetts and New Hampshire ratifying conventions both discussing putting a time limit on suspension of <em>habeas corpus</em> even under extreme conditions. Otherwise, this clause was generally accepted.");sym.$("txt_a1s9c3").html("Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 prohibits the passage of bills of attainder or ex post facto laws. Bills of attainder are pieces of legislation that can declare individuals guilty of a crime without a fair trial and <em>ex post facto</em> laws punish a crime after it was committed. There was relative unanimity at the Convention on the inclusion of the provision against bills of attainder. The <em>ex post facto</em> provision raised greater debate because some delegates such as Morris, Ellsworth, and Wilson felt that &quot;ex post facto laws were void of themselves&quot; (August 29). After Dickinson of Delaware presented the legal defition of <em>ex post facto</em> as applying only to criminal cases, they agreed to include this provision. At the state ratification conventions, there was no relevant discussion of this clause.");sym.$("txt_a1s9c4").html("Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 prohibits any taxation that is not in proportion to the ten-year census, and Clause 5 prevents taxation on &quot;articles exported from any state.&quot; Madison's notes record little debate on these two sections at the convention.

Thomas Davies at the Massachusetts convention and Richard Spaight at the North Carolina convention both suggest and later dismiss the idea of basing direct taxation on the basis of land area rather than population. Davies concludes his speech simply, &quot;the rule laid down in the paragraph is the best that can be obtained for the apportionment of the little direct taxes which Congress will want.&quot;");sym.$("txt_a1s9c6").html("Article 1, Section 9, Clause 6 states that &quot;No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another; nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear or pay Duties in another.&quot; This provision sought to ensure that federal regulations did not preference one state's ports over those of other states. In addition, this provision sought to remedy the historic problem of interstate good exchange during the period of the Articles of Confederation, when duties between states were so high that oftentimes merchants were encouraged to look to international trade partners by prohibiting states from taxing goods that originated in another state.");sym.$("txt_a1s9c7").html("Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 states that: &quot;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.&quot; Joseph Story in <em>Commentaries on the United States Constitution 3</em> also cites that importance of congressional control of appropriations to protect funds from exclusively executive power.");sym.$("txt_a1s10c1").html("After limiting the powers of the Federal government in Article 1, Section 9, the Constitution limits the power of the state governments in Article I, Section 10. Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 reflects the problems under the Articles of Confederation. First and foremost, that clause restricts states from forming any alliances with foreign nations, leaving this power expressly to the executive branch. Under the confederation government, many states, especially in the South, had developed trade alliances with European nations such as England, France, and Spain. Under the new Constitution, however, those alliances were viewed as detrimental to national unity. Clause 1 also limits granting &quot;letters of marque or reprisal,&quot; which would endorse acts of piracy against private seafaring vessels. The clause also prevents states from coining money, another source of detriment to the nascent American economy in the aftermath of the revolution.
