representative, a statesman, a Founding Father, a Secretary of State, and president of the United States, Madison was also the nation’s first political scientist. Although the ostensible purpose of the Federalist Papers was to convince the states to ratify the Constitution by explaining the roles and functions of the new government, they also contain theoretical arguments about the nature of government. The Madisonial Model is a theory of how government should work in a large republic. To recap our lesson from Module 1, the “great object” of the Constitution as described in Federalist No. 10 was “To secure the public good, and private rights, against the danger of such a faction [majority faction], and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government…” It is important to emphasize that he ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_117","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_117","title":"was not opposed to majorities in principle, he was opposed to majority factions—majorities that were “tyrannical,” “overbearing,” and “unjust.” The challenge to the framers was to create a government that relied on the “republican principle,” one that allowed the majority to rule without trampling on the rights of the minority or undermining public interest.  The answer for Madison was a large republic that would produce natural and social checks on majority tyranny. The Madisonian Model begins with the premise that a republic is better than pure democracy, which resorts to “common passions” and “can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction.” And, a large republic is better than a small republic. Since factions are “sown in the nature of man,” they cannot be removed without undermining liberty; thus, the answer is to “control the effects” of factions. The best way to control the effects of majority faction is to let factions flourish by enlarging the republic: “Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens...” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Slide6973","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Madisonian Model","thumbnail":"dr/Slide6973_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14330","S4_button_previous","si17045","si17059","S4_button_next","si17075","si17089","Text_Caption_116","Text_Caption_117"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide6973"}}},{"id":"si18323","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_37","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_37","title":"The Madisonian Model ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_23","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_23","title":"The “Just Majority” ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_90","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_90","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17195","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17209","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_91","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_91","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17225","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17239","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_167","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_167","title":"The Madisonian Model of majority formation can be portrayed in a series of relationships that begin with an extended republic and end with just policy outcomes.

Yet, while Madison distrusted direct democracy, he expressed confidence in the ability of the people to fulfill an essential role in republican governance. In a large republic the people will be able to discern between good and bad representatives. Thus, “the greater the number of citizens in a large than a small republic…the suffrages of the people being more free, will be more likely to center on men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.” The people will not elect “Men who would be disposed to form and pursue a scheme of treachery or tyranny.”  Ultimately, “we the people” in a large republic can be depended upon to act justly: “what is to restrain the House of Representatives from making legal discriminations in favor of themselves and a particular class of the society? I answer: the genius of the whole system; the nature of just and constitutional laws; and, above all, the vigilant and manly spirit which actuates the people of America—a spirit which nourishes freedom, and in return is nourished by it.” Although Madison commends the institutional checks on government as a means of protecting liberty, he also convenys confidence in the people by stating that elections would be the first check on government: “A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on government…” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_92","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_92","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17345","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17359","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_93","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_93","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17375","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17389","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_179","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_179","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_180","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_180","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide14464","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"\"We the People\"","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14464_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14498","si14500","Text_Caption_121","Button_92","si17345","si17359","Button_93","si17375","si17389","Image_179","Image_180"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14464"}}},{"id":"si14859","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14861","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_39","title":"The Madisonian Model ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_25","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_25","title":"“A Cool and Deliberate Sense of Community” ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_129","title":"The critical difference for Madison is between unfiltered and an unreflective public opinion that rules in a pure democracy or a small republic, and a better informed, deliberate majority that is more likely in a large republic.

A republican form of government should “refine and enlarge the public views.” Thus, “the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for the purpose.”  Elected bodies of representatives are more apt to reflect the “cool and deliberate sense of community,” which “in all free governments ultimately prevail over its rulers.” Representatives should guard against “particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_94","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_94","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17495","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17509","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_95","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_95","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17525","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17539","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_181","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_181","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide14825","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"\"A Cool and Deliberate Sense of Community\"","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14825_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14859","si14861","Text_Caption_129","Button_94","si17495","si17509","Button_95","si17525","si17539","Image_181"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14825"}}},{"id":"si15074","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15076","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_40","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_40","title":"The Madisonian Model ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_145","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_145","roles":{}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_26","title":"Public Opinion ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_134","title":"The “public voice” still matters, so long as it is informed by the interplay between representatives and the people.

In this respect, the Madisonian Model fits the description of a deliberative democracy. Public opinion matters when it is filtered through a body of representatives chosen from a large geographical area with multiple and diverse interests. This filtering takes time, which means that the legislative process must by necessity be slow enough to allow for consideration of the public’s views.

Political scientist William Connelly argues that many challenges faced by contemporary party leaders can be traced to the United States Constitution. Congressional party leaders must deal with factions, including factions within and across political parties and within and outside Congress, and they must do so within the context of the separation of powers. As Madison would expect, majorities are and should be difficult to forge in American government. Moreover, as Madison predicted, an extended republic would be overwhelmed with factions. America is a pluralistic society and interest groups certainly influence public policy and the legislative process. Members of Congress as individuals and Congress as a whole must deal with the clamor and conflicts associated with interest group demands and party politics. The vast majority of laws passed by Congress emerge from a process roughly as Madison described it. In this respect, in the words of William Connelly, “Madison rules America.”  Yet, a theory of governance derived from a combination of historical knowledge, direct experiences, and practical compromises between thirteen states with a population of 2.6 million people in 1787 is bound to have a few limitations when applied to a country with 50 states and a population of well over 300 million people.  The effects of hyperpluralism are debatable; the sluggish formation of majorities has always looked like justice to some and gridlock to others. Nonetheless, the specter of policy gridlock has caused reformers to seek solutions to problems that trouble the contemporary Congress.

Although Madison does not necessarily assume otherwise, the diverse factions and interests in the extended republic have unequal power and access. Political scientiest E.E. Schattschneider once remarked that “The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent.” Unequal access and resources encourages some groups to pursue tactics outside of the policymaking process. Rather than engage in a competitive group struggle within the legislative system, some factions may engender social movements or engage in protests in order to shape public opinion. Furthermore, if the political process does not result in change at a rapid enough pace, factions can pursue their interests through the judicial rather than the legislative process. This was the case, for example, with the Civil Rights Movement in the 1940s and 1950s, which began to desegregate public accommodations through judicial action, long before Congress acted in the 1960s.

What if pluralism becomes “hyperpluralism?” Madison in Federalist No. 10 says a minority faction is harmless: “relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views, by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution.” Yet, in the process of reconciling differences between competing groups, legislators create government programs. Once programs are established, organized interests benefit economically and work to maintain them. Over time, groups form alliances with executive agencies, representatives, and political parties and their program benefits grow, or become very difficult to cut.

Government becomes ossified. The proliferation of too many groups—hyperpluralism—can cause paralysis or gridlock, particularly with respect to reducing or eliminating benefit programs guarded by rent-seeking and entrenched interests.  According to Rauch, one consequence of “extending the sphere” has been an extensive list of benefits aimed to satisfy the interests of a variety of organized groups. A small sample of such benefits might include: depletion allowances for oil companies, ethanol subsidies for corn growers, cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries, mortgage deductions for homebuyers, and tax credits for having children. Quite apart from the merits of those or many other government programs, when one considers the number of groups, individuals, and corporiations from government programs, the derogatory term “special interests” loses its meaning. “’They’ [the special interest] are, in fact us—you and me.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_176","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_176","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_106","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_106","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17975","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si17989","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide15895","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Special Interest Groups and Hyerpluralism","thumbnail":"dr/Slide15895_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si16042","Image_154","SmartShape_9","Text_Caption_154","Text_Caption_155","Image_176","Button_106","si17975","si17989"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide15895"}}},{"id":"Pool502","class":"pool","roles":{"pool":{"id":502,"name":"Pool1","questions":[]}}},{"id":"madisonian","class":"project","title":"madisonian","children":["Slide6496","Slide14208","Slide6973","Slide14359","Slide14464","Slide14825","Slide15040","Slide15262","Slide15336","Slide15416","Slide15764","Slide15895"],"roles":{"quiz":{"id":458,"branched":false,"submitAll":false,"review":true,"questions":[],"minScore":0,"maxScore":0,"passScore":0}}}],"contentSettings":{"global":{"branchAware":false},"toc":{"navigationEnabled":true,"navigateVisitedSlides":false,"collapseAll":true,"showTopicDuration":false,"statusFlag":true,"selfPaced":true,"showSearch":true,"enabled":true},"playbar":{"enabled":false,"cc":true,"playPause":true,"back":true,"forward":true,"rewind":true,"close":true,"mute":true,"progressBar":true}},"contentReporting":{"CCCriteria":"launch_content","SCCriteria":"launch_content","exitNormalIfCompleted":false},"toc":[{"id":"Slide6496","title":"Title Page","visible":true},{"id":"Slide14208","title":"Sections","visible":true},{"id":"Slide6973","title":"The Madisonian Model","visible":true},{"id":"Slide14359","title":"The \"Just Majority\"","visible":true},{"id":"Slide14464","title":"\"We the People\"","visible":true},{"id":"Slide14825","title":"\"A Cool and Deliberate Sense of Community\"","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15040","title":"Public Opinion","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15262","title":"Video - The Politics of Congress","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15336","title":"Limitations to the Madisonian Model","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15416","title":"Failure of Reconciliation","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15764","title":"Pursuing Interests Outside of Government","visible":true},{"id":"Slide15895","title":"Special Interest Groups and Hyerpluralism","visible":true}]}
