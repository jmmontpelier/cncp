Mann and Normal J. Ornestein, Congress has become The Broken Branch. Mann and Ornstein link the problems to the behavior of congressional institutions in the post-reform House: “…ad hoc arrangements that often circumvented the normal committee process, restrictive rules that limited debate and amendments on the House floor, and behemoth omnibus legislative packages that short-circuited the normal process, limited transparency, and rendered the majority less accountable.” Meanwhile, the Senate has become a “bastion of individualism,” that has “spread the wealth to accommodate the interests—and whims—of every member.” One of the most significant factors in the changing character of both the House and Senate seems to be party polarization, which has elevated the power of the majority party in the House, allowing the minority party to obstruct business in the Senate, and created policy gridlock. Political journalist Ronald Brownstein agrees: “The central obstacle to more effective action against our most pressing problems is an unrelenting polarization of American politics that has divided Washington and the country into hostile, even irreconcilable camps.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_196","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_196","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide6973","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Causes and Consequences of Institutional Dysfunction","thumbnail":"dr/Slide6973_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14239","si14241","S4_button_previous","si17727","si17741","S4_button_next","si17757","si17771","Text_Caption_111","Image_196"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide6973"}}},{"id":"si14517","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14519","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_38","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_38","title":"Congress and the American People ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_23","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_23","title":"Causes and Consequences of Institutional Dysfunction ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_120","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_120","title":"The Breakdown of Congress?

First, Congress is weaker in relation to the president. Mann and Ornstein say that under unified party control during the Bush presidency, the Republican majority failed to check President Bush’s use of executive power, including his tendency to act unilaterally rather than work with Congress. When Congress cannot act, it may embolden the executive branch and increase its power vis-à-vis the legislative branch. Secondly, Mann and Ornstein say that a breakdown in “regular order” has undermined Congress’ capacity to gather good information and deliberate over policy options. Ultimately, Mann and Ornstein believe that the result of a dysfunctional process is poorly designed public policy that may be deemed unconstitutional by the courts or allow the executive branch significant leeway in its interpretation. Finally, they say that partisanship has poisoned public discourse and further eroded public confidence. Mann and Ornstein argue that Congress is “an institution that has strayed far from its deliberate roots and a body that does not live up to the aspirations envisioned for it by the framers.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"S4_button_previous_100","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_previous_100","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19049","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19074","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"S4_button_next_101","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"S4_button_next_101","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19128","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19153","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_203","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_203","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_204","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_204","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide14483","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Breakdown of Congress?","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14483_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14517","si14519","Text_Caption_120","Text_Caption_121","S4_button_previous_100","si19049","si19074","S4_button_next_101","si19128","si19153","Image_203","Image_204"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14483"}}},{"id":"si14648","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_191","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_191","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_39","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_39","title":"Congress and the American People ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_24","title":"Reforming Congress ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_125","title":"Reformers have presented many ideas to improve Congress.

The ultimate test is how well reforms measure up to expectations of deliberative democracy, or in Madison’s terms from Federalist No. 10, whether they enable Congress to “refine and enlarge the public interest.” In this vein, we also need to realize that reforms can have a limited and unintended consequences.

Still, reforming the cloture rule may not dramatically improve the flow of business in the Senate. As the graph in Module 5 demonstrates, when the Senate made it easier to invoke cloture in 1975 by reducing the number of votes required to end a filibuster from 2/3 to 3/5, the number of filibusters and cloture votes did not decline—in fact, they increased significantly. Many observers have noted that as it becomes easier to invoke cloture, the costs to filibustering have gone down over time, which has the perverse consequence of increasing senators’ willingness to engage in the tactic.

Those consequences stem from institutional and political realities that define the Congress. Institutionally, reforms designed to improve representation can adversely affect lawmaking, and vice versa. Reforms to purify the legislative process of earmarks may strengthen the executive branch. Politically, reforming rules and procedures may conflict with the individual goals of members, such as re-election. Political scientist Scott Adler concludes that “any widespread change in the established order of policy deliberation—particularly in its centerpiece, the committee system—would create far too much uncertainty in members’ electoral strategy.”  Not only are the effects of reforms uncertain and debatable, the feasibility of reform depends on  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_164","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_164","title":"agreement about the extent and causes of institutional dysfunction. Reform—from diagnosis of problems to prescriptions for solving them—is inherently normative. Some scholars see partisan polarization as the primary cause of gridlock, malfunction, and declining public confidence, but others point out that partisanship dates to the Founding era. In a correspondence with Richard Henry Lee in 1824, Madison observed: “parties seem to have a permanent foundation in the various political opinions in free states.” And, “The constitution itself…must be an unfailing source of party distinction.” In a 1792 essay entitled “A Candid State of the Parties,” Madison concluded that the “partisan division” witnessed in Congress during the early 1790s is “natural to most political societies.”  The degree of partisanship varies over time and polarization is higher today than in most periods of American history, but partisanship is a prevailing aspect of American politics. Moreover, as we learned in Module 6, partisanship has not prevented Congress and the president from passing legislation or building bipartisan coalitions. The Constitution permits multiple ways to govern. Parties are among the many factions that persist in the extended republic, and party leaders have multiple ways of dealing with both constitutional and factional obstacles to coalition building.

Reform is complicated by multiple competing interests, including those that have a stake in the status quo. As the political scientist Eric Schickler has argued, “legislative institutions are historical composites, full of tensions and contradictions. Congressional development does not produce some stable, effective compromise that is reasonably satisfactory to all (or even most) members. Instead, it produces a set of institutions that work at cross-purposes.” Throughout the history of Congress, leaders like Thomas Reed, Newt Gingrich, and others, have instituted reforms, but those changes often do not displace existing institutions. Rather, reform “involves superimposing new arrangements on top of preexisting structures intended to serve different purposes.” Perhaps more than reformers may want to admit, the contemporary Congress is, according to Schickler, “rooted in a constitutional framework and electoral system that help to produce members for whom multiple collective interests are likely to be salient.”  If Schickler is correct, we search in vain for a single, coherent and sustainable Congress. The framers created a system that permits multiple models of lawmaking, representation, and deliberation; multiple ways for Congress, the president, and the courts to interact; and multiple means through which public opinion can affect institutions and public policy.
