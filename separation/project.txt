of powers was uncommon in the Framers’ experience. In his review of state governments in Federalist No. 47, Madison found “that there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct.” In order to guard against governmental tyranny, the Constitution must do more than separate powers. Madison concludes in Federalist No. 48: “…a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands.” Some mixing of blending of the powers provides additional checks on governmental tyranny: “But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department, the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others.”  Madison highlighted the dominance of the legislative branch as a pretext for checking legislative power. “We have seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of other departments.” And, “The legislative department is everywhere extended the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” Thus, as noted in Module 5 (Bicameralism), Madison concluded: “In republican government the legislative authority necessarily predominates.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_69","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_69","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19961","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19975","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_70","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_70","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si19991","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20005","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_187","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_187","title":"Federalist No. 47 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_131","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_131","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_203","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_203","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_71","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_71","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20021","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20035","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14767","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Preserving LIberty and Preventing Governmental Tyranny","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14767_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14801","si14803","Text_Caption_127","Text_Caption_128","Button_69","si19961","si19975","Button_70","si19991","si20005","Text_Caption_187","Image_131","Image_203","Button_71","si20021","si20035"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14767"}}},{"id":"si14881","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14883","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_41","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_41","title":"Separation of Powers and Interaction between the Branches ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_28","title":"Checking Power ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_129","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_129","title":"The “danger of legislative usurpations” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_130","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_130","title":"Why did the framers believe that the legislature was most susceptible to dominating in a republican form of government? What was the “danger of legislative usurpations”? How is it that “The legislative department derives a superiority in our governments”? Madison gives several reasons in Federalist No. 48:  The legislative draws its strength from a democratic source: “the legislative power is exercised by an assembly, which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength.” The legislature may be “sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude; yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passion by means which reason prescribes.” It is difficult to design constraints on the legislature’s power: “Its constitutional powers being at once more extensive, and less susceptible of precise limits, it can, with the greater facility, mask, under complicated and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on the co-ordinate departments.” The legislature has the power of the purse, “the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in all a prevailing influence, over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_214","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_214","title":"Federalist No. 48 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_186","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_186","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_101","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_101","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20201","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20215","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_102","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_102","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20231","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20245","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_204","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_204","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_98","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_98","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20111","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20125","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14847","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The \"danger of legislative usurpations\"","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14847_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14881","si14883","Text_Caption_129","Text_Caption_130","Text_Caption_214","Image_186","Button_101","si20201","si20215","Button_102","si20231","si20245","Image_204","Button_98","si20111","si20125"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14847"}}},{"id":"si14961","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si14963","class":"TODO::Senthil","title":" ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"si14978","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_42","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_42","title":"Separation of Powers and Interaction between the Branches ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_131","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_131","title":"Congress and the Executive Branch ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Web_3","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Web_3","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_103","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_103","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20261","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20275","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_104","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_104","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20291","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20305","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide14927","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Video - Congress and the Executive Branch","thumbnail":"dr/Slide14927_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si14961","si14963","si14978","Text_Caption_131","Button_103","si20261","si20275","Button_104","si20291","si20305"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide14927"}}},{"id":"si15035","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si15037","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_43","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_43","title":"Separation of Powers and Interaction between the Branches ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_29","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_29","title":"Congress and the President ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_134","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_134","title":"In order to balance the power of the legislature with the executive, Madison observed in Federalist No. 51: “As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided, the weaknesses of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified.” One power that the framers ensured would be shared between Congress and the president was the lawmaking authority. Although Congress is primarily responsible for making the laws, the president has the constitutional authority to veto any measure in one of two ways:  The straightforward veto, which is to “return it [the bill] with his objects...” The pocket veto, where the president refuses to sign the bill and Congress adjourns within ten days of passage (not counting Sundays).  Hamilton, in Federalist No. 73, writes: “The primary inducement to conferring the power in question upon the executive is to enable him to defend himself; the secondary one is to increase the chances in favor of the community against the passing of bad laws, through haste, inadvertence, or design.” In fact, Hamilton believed, the presence or threat of a veto could affect Congress: “A power of this nature in the executive will often have a silent and unperceived, though forcible, operation. When men, engaged in unjustifiable pursuits, are aware that obstructions may come from a quarter which they cannot control, they will often be restrained by the bare apprehension of opposition from doing what they would in eagerness rush into if no such external impediments were to be feared.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_105","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_105","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20411","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20425","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_106","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_106","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20441","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"si20455","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_217","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_217","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_231","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_231","title":"John J.

On ordinary occasions, it might not be exerted with the requisite firmness; and on extraordinary occasions, it might be perfidiously abused” (Federalist No. 51).

They did not expect the president to set up Congress’ policy agenda except in times of crisis, particularly when Congress was not in session…Legislative draftsman, congressional lobbyist, and coalition builder—there is little indication that the framers expected or wanted the president to assume any of those roles on a regular basis.

In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson delivered a State of the Union address to Congress, and from that point it has become the primary means through which the president seeks to set the legislative agenda.  Wilson’s use of the State of the Union address was one of the first signs of the emergence of the “modern president,” a term used to define the expectations we have of the president today. The modern president should have a dynamic personality; exert legislative leadership by setting the policy agenda and cajoling Congress to address the nation’s challenges; use the media to project an image of strength in national and global affairs; broadly interpret the Constitution’s executive power; and have the institutional capacity to handle the responsibilities of a world power and modern welfare state. All of the essential elements of the modern president came together under Franklin Roosevelt, who set a standard for his successors.

In 1973, Arthur Schlesinger argued that the presidency was “resurgent” in World War II, “ascendant” during the Korean War, and “rampant” in the Vietnam War. Schlesinger deemed Nixon to be a revolutionary president. More recent versions of the imperial presidency point to George Bush’s use of executive power in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or President Obama’s executive orders to protect certain undocumented immigrants from being deported. The assumption behind the imperial presidency is that the president has won the competition for power, and the presidency is the only institution that has means, legitimacy, and popular support to provide national leadership. Moreover, the president can govern either with the consent of Congress or, if necessary, exert executive power independent of Congress.

The classic case was in 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won the presidency in a landslide with 61% of the popular vote and the Democrats added 36 seats to the House. The mandate was clear and Congress followed through by enacting major legislation in health care (Medicare and Medicaid) and civil rights. The election of 1980 looked like a mandate as well. Republican Ronald Reagan won only 51% of the popular vote, but he took 44 states and a total of 489 Electoral College votes, and his party gained 34 seats in the House and 12 in the Senate. The Republicans did not have a majority in the House, but Reagan did have the support of a conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The Congress pushed through Reagan’s programs of tax cuts, defense spending increases, and reductions in domestic spending. The 2008 election also qualifies as a mandate for responsible party government. Barack Obama promised change and he won a solid 53% of the vote, while his party gained 20 House seats and 6 Senate seats. The Democratic Congress rallied to pass a major economic stimulus bill and health care reform—the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

What does this mean for governing? According to theory, when the voters do not deliver unified party government or a clear popular mandate, the political system is bound to be gridlocked. Thus, whereas responsible parties can make the system “work” in terms of producing legislation in accordance with public opinion, divided party control of Congress and the presidency is not likely to produce much, particularly in the current era of hyperpartisanship. Without majorities of the same party in both the House and Senate, the president resorts to executive power and acts independently of Congress to achieve his goals. Thus recently, presidents routinely use executive orders to carry out policy, write signing statements on bills they don’t want to veto, and negotiate major international agreements with little concern about congressional approval. Presidents justify taking such actions, for, as President Obama remarked, “we can’t wait” for Congress to act.  In the face of divided government, unilateral executive action reflects the modern president’s impatience with Enlightenment notions of balance of power or republican governance. The modern president who governs by popular mandate replaces the House as the primary linkage to, and voice of, the people. One is left to wonder, under such a scheme, whether it is possible to hear the “mild voice of reason” amidst the “clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain” (Federalist No. 42).

Charles Jones has demonstrated that while the president may initiate proposals, plenty of bills start and are refined within the Congress. Moreover, Congress can and does check presidential power, either by building legislative capacity or by rejecting or significantly altering the president’s programs. In addition, by limiting the terms of House members to every two years and requiring one-third of the Senate to be elected every two years, the Constitution gives the voters the power to check a Responsible Party Government that might arise during a presidential election year.

Johnson and congressional Democrats pushed through major Great Society programs. But, with turmoil at home and war in Vietnam, public confidence in the president eroded and Johnson declined to run for re-election. In 1968, the voters elected Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon and his party gained a handful of seats in the House and Senate. In 1980, Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan won an Electoral College landslide victory over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Meanwhile, Republicans gained 34 House seats, enough to combine with conservative Democrats to form a working conservative majority in the House, and 12 Senate seats to gain majority control of the Senate. The Congress quickly enacted Reagan’s economic plan, including major tax cuts, but the economy struggled and Democrats regained 26 seats in the 1982 midterm elections. In 2008, Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, won a sweeping victory for change and Democrats increased their majorities in the House and Senate. But, after Congress enacted a major economic stimulus plan and an historic health care reform, in 2010 Republicans gained 63 seats (enough to regain the majority) and 6 Senate seats. Thus, episodes of responsible party government tend to be rare and short-lived.

The president and members of Congress are still elected by different constituents (and therefore answer to different voters); they hold office for different terms; and they are often elected in different years (thus they often campaign on different issues). The parties are more unified and polarized than they used to be, but party members don’t always hold together and they are not always opposed to their counterparts from the other party. Opinion polls always report higher approval ratings for the president than for Congress, but every president faces low approval ratings from time-to-time and thus cannot always count on public opinion, and individual members of Congress are routinely re-elected to office. Finally, Congress and the president have independent powers, but often rely upon one another to advance their policy goals.

Beginning with Marbury v. Madison in 1803, the Court has invalidated over 170 laws passed by Congress. Judicial review was used only twice to invalidate federal laws before the Civil War, but grew with the increase in laws and regulations. Judicial review peaked between 1921 and 1936, when the Court invalidated 29 laws.  Third, the Court may act as a “catalyst” for legislative action. One example is the case of Brown v. the Board of Education (1954), where the Court struck down the separate-but-equal standard regarding state laws for segregating schools. The Court did not have independent power to enforce its decisions, but Congress acted over the next decade to pass legislation designed to end segregation and racial discrimination.

The constitutional powers of Congress were more clearly specified than the other two branches, and the executive was more fully developed than the judiciary. Yet, the seeds of a powerful executive and an active judiciary were sown in the Constitution. The language in Article II, Section 1: “The Executive power shall be vested in the President of the United States,” leaves room for plenty of interpretation. Conditions that gave rise to the modern president and growth in the size of government gave new meaning to term “executive power.” The power wielded by modern presidents clearly extends executive power beyond the reach of emergencies or times when Congress is not in session. The interaction between Congress and the Courts is much less regular than the interaction between Congress and the president. Nonetheless, an activist Court has expanded judicial power enough to provoke congressional checks from time to time.  The contemporary Congress competes for power with a powerful president that is recognized as both an executive and a legislative leader, and a Court that has from time-to-time been accused of “legislating from the bench.” Still, the president needs a Congress to enact new programs and independent actions by the president, such as executive orders, are limited to the length of the presidency and may provoke a response from Congress. The Court is more formidable, but it can only respond to cases and has limited enforcement capability. The debate over which of the branches is most powerful is endless and futile.
